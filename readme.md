<h1 align="center">RETURN OF THE JET HIGH: An SQL Airline Analytics Project</h1>  

![Logo](https://github.com/JBaptisteAll/Return-of-the-Jet-High-An-SQL-Airline-Analytics-Project/blob/main/Assets/logo.png)

## üìå Introduction

RETURN OF THE JET HIGH is the sequel to *Revenge of the Seat*.  
Whereas the first project focused on designing and populating a relational SQL database, this one explores **airline analytics** using advanced SQL queries and views.  

It answers business-driven questions on **revenues, delays, routes, aircraft utilization, and passenger behavior**, while also preparing **views ready to be used in BI tools** such as Power BI.

---

## üìö Background

This project was created as part of a personal portfolio to demonstrate **SQL analytics capabilities**.  
It builds on the existing airline database to simulate real-world scenarios such as:
- Determining the most profitable routes  
- Measuring punctuality across airports  
- Estimating fuel needs based on aircraft performance  
- Segmenting passengers into meaningful categories  

---

## üß± Database Schema

The analysis leverages the same schema introduced in *Revenge of the Seat*, which includes:

| Table               | Description                                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `aircraft`          | Stores technical and commercial details about each aircraft.  |
| `airlines`          | Contains airline company data (name, HQ, employees, etc).     |
| `airports`          | Includes global airport data (location, size, capacity).      |
| `passenger`         | Passenger demographics and frequent flyer info.               |
| `flights`           | Central fact table listing flights, delay info, revenue, etc. |
| `passenger_flights` | Join table linking passengers to flights with seat/class.     |

## üß™ Data Overview

The analytical queries in this project rely on a dataset designed to mimic real-world airline operations.  
It contains **hundreds of thousands of rows** across flights, passengers, aircraft, airlines, and airports, enabling complex scenarios to be explored:


| Table               | # of Rows |
|---------------------|-----------|
| `aircraft`          | 19        |
| `airlines`          | 11        |
| `airports`          | 32        |
| `passenger`         | 100,007   |
| `passenger_flights` | 700,008   |
| `flights`           | 25,001    |


- Each passenger is linked to multiple flights, averaging **7 bookings per person**.  
- Flight statuses include *On Time*, *Delayed*, and *Cancelled*, which drive punctuality analysis.  
- Aircraft carry technical fields such as **fuel capacity** and **burn rate**, supporting operational insights.  

This scale makes the dataset a solid foundation for demonstrating **SQL analytics, KPIs, and BI-ready views**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **SQL Server** ‚Äì to execute and test queries  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ‚Äì for SQL scripting and formatting  
- **Power BI (planned)** ‚Äì to visualize key KPIs from the SQL views

## üìà What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen both my **technical SQL skills** and my **business-oriented thinking**:

- **SQL Engineering**: Designing clean and reusable SQL views that can serve as a foundation for further analysis or BI dashboards.  
- **Advanced Querying**: Applying window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `AVG`, `SUM`) to perform ranking, segmentation, and KPI calculations.  
- **Business Metrics**: Translating raw flight data into meaningful indicators such as revenue per passenger, on-time rate, and cancellation rate.  
- **Analytics to BI**: Preparing datasets that can be directly connected to **Power BI**, ensuring a smooth transition from backend SQL to data visualization.  
- **Storytelling with Data**: Moving beyond queries to interpret the results, highlighting profitability drivers, operational inefficiencies, and customer behavior patterns.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Analytics Engineering Perspective

This project is designed following an **Analytics Engineering mindset**, where raw operational data is progressively transformed into **business-ready datasets**.

### üîÑ Data Transformation Layers (dbt-inspired)
- **Raw layer**: Original tables (`flights`, `passenger`, `aircraft`, ‚Ä¶) as ingested from the simulation.
- **Staging layer (stg_*)**: Cleaned and standardized views (e.g., handling cancellations, unifying date formats).
- **Analytics layer (dim_ / fct_*)**: Business-oriented datasets, such as:
  - `fct_airline_kpis`: KPIs per airline (revenues, on-time rate, cancellations).
  - `fct_routes`: Most profitable routes with revenue per passenger.
  - `dim_passenger_segments`: Age-based and loyalty-based segmentation.

This layered approach ensures **clarity, modularity, and reusability**.

### üìä Why it matters
By exposing analytics-ready views:
- BI tools like **Power BI** can connect directly, reducing time-to-insight.
- Analysts no longer need to write complex SQL, ensuring **consistency** of business metrics.
- Business users get **trusted datasets** aligned with company definitions (e.g., on-time rate is always calculated the same way).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Quality & CI/CD
- **Testing**: Simple SQL tests (row counts, null checks, referential integrity) ensure reliable outputs.
- **Versioning**: Queries and views are version-controlled in GitHub.
- **Refresh**: Views can be refreshed on a schedule (daily/weekly), simulating an ELT pipeline.

While I haven‚Äôt implemented tools like dbt or Airflow yet, this project was designed with the same mindset, focusing on clarity, modularity, and reusable analytics-ready datasets.

## ü•ö Easter Egg Revealed

In *Revenge of the Seat*, a secret was hidden inside the dataset.  
One particular flight stood out: **a fully booked trip to the Death Star** üöÄ.  

```SQL
-- Easter Egg revealed
SELECT 
    f.flight_id,
    ap.airport_name AS departure,
    ap2.airport_name AS destination,
    ac.aircraft_type,

    CONCAT(p.first_name,' ',p.last_name) AS passenger,
    p.birthdate
FROM flights AS f  
JOIN passenger_flights AS pf ON pf.flight_id = f.flight_id

JOIN aircraft AS ac ON ac.aircraft_id = f.aircraft_id
JOIN airlines AS al ON al.airline_code = f.airline_code
JOIN airports AS ap ON ap.airport_code = f.departure_airport_code

It was a playful nod to the project‚Äôs Star Wars‚Äìinspired naming, and a reminder that data can also be fun to explore.  

By revealing it here in *Return of the Jet High*, the saga comes full circle ‚Äî mixing serious SQL analytics with a touch of creativity.

---
## üîÆ Final Notes

This project transforms the airline database into a **practical analytics playground**,  
bridging the gap between **data modeling** (*Revenge of the Seat*) and **data analysis** (*Return of the Jet High*).  

It demonstrates how far you can go with **SQL alone** ‚Äî from exploring KPIs to preparing BI-ready datasets.  
Together, the two projects form a complete cycle: one focused on building the database, the other on unlocking its insights.  

Because in the end, as Master Yoda reminds us about the Sith:  
üí¨ *‚ÄúAlways two there are, no more, no less.‚Äù*  
So too must this SQL saga be told ‚Äî in pairs.
